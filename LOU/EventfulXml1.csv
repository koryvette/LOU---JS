Odeon,The Other Favorites and Reina del Cid at Odeon," The Other Favorites is the long time duo project of Carson McKee and Josh Turner. Perhaps best known for their performances on YouTube, which have garnered millions of views. The Other Favorites are now based out of Brooklyn, NY. Together, Turner and McKee bring their shared influences of folk, bluegrass and classic rock into a modern framework; one distinguished by incisive songwriting, virtuosic guitar work and tight two-part harmony. Reina del Cid is a singer songwriter and leader of the eponymous folk rock band based in Los Angeles. Her song-a-week video series, Sunday Mornings with Reina del Cid, has amassed over 45 million views on YouTube and collected a diverse following made up of everyone from jamheads to college students to white-haired intelligentsia. In 2011 she began collaborating with Toni Lindgren, who is the lead guitarist on all three of Del Cids albums, as well as a frequent and much beloved guest on the Sunday Morning videos. The two have adapted their sometimes hard-hitting rock ballads and catchy pop riffs into a special acoustic duo set.<br> <br>

Tree of Life Education Center,Planning For Birth & Postpartum," Planning For Birth & Postpartum is one of three required classes for families who plan to give birth at Tree of Life Family Birth Center. Please read the class guidelines carefully before registering: You only need one ticket, or one registration--it covers mom *and* her choice of birth partner. Please do not register twice! Attendance is limited to mothers (and their birth partners) who are in their third trimester. Birth partners are strongly encouraged to attend as we will go over information related to postpartum and newborn care in the first 48 hours after discharge from Tree of Life. This is an adults only class; please secure childcare for older children and babies. This class does not serve as preparation for natural birth--we will not learn about comfort measures, coping with labor, stages of labor, etc. Those concepts should be explored in a weekly independent childbirth class series.

Jimmy Can't Dance,Colleen Orender," Nashville Recording Artist Colleen Orender&#39;s new music is a sultry jazz dream with pop sensibilities and a touch of James Bond. A touring jazz and blues artist for decades, Orender turns your hometown venues into smoldering 1930&#39;s Mississippi juke joints. She teamed up with Michael Davey in Nashville to produce her new sound that many are comparing to Amy Winehouse with Julie London&#39;s essence. We see a new genre stand on its own, the Sophisticated Pop of the decade.",2020-08-22, 21:00:00,,,http://louisville.eventful.com/events/colleen-orender-/E0-001-134218055-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Louisville,,1

Tree of Life Education Center,Planning For Birth & Postpartum," Planning For Birth & Postpartum is one of three required classes for families who plan to give birth at Tree of Life Family Birth Center. Please read the class guidelines carefully before registering: You only need one ticket, or one registration--it covers mom *and* her choice of birth partner. Please do not register twice! Attendance is limited to mothers (and their birth partners) who are in their third trimester. Birth partners are strongly encouraged to attend as we will go over information related to postpartum and newborn care in the first 48 hours after discharge from Tree of Life. This is an adults only class; please secure childcare for older children and babies. This class does not serve as preparation for natural birth--we will not learn about comfort measures, coping with labor, stages of labor, etc. Those concepts should be explored in a weekly independent childbirth class series.
